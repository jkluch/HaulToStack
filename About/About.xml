&lt;size=18&gt;Version 1.0.0&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;size=18&gt;This version also works with beta 19&lt;/size&gt;

&lt;size=18&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Haulers will check for an existing stack to add it's item to.
Haulers no longer reserve the haul-to tile meaning multiple pawns can haul to the same tile at once.

&lt;size=18&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;
You may still see your pawns haul to different stacks, this will happen under the following conditions:
there are no existing stacks,
the existing stacks are full

Example:  If you get a pod drop with new loot and two pawns pickup some before any is placed, they might pick different spots in the stockpile to haul to.  I'm working on a system where they can share with eachother which tile they plan on placing new loot on which should fix that issue.

&lt;size=18&gt;Conflicts&lt;/size&gt;
Mods that add special containers might conflict with this mod.  If you have a problem, typically the 'standing' bug please remove the mod and try to provide information on the issue in the workshop thread.
This mod should be compatible with most other mods but let me know if you have any problems.

Thanks to @Trips on the rimworld discord server for the Haul to Stack preview picture.
