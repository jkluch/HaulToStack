[h1]Compatible with Versions 1.0, 1.1[/h1]
  
[h1]Features[/h1]
Haulers will check for an existing stack to add it's item to.
Haulers no longer reserve the haul-to tile meaning multiple pawns can haul to the same tile at once.


[h1]Issues[/h1]
You may still see your pawns haul to different stacks, this will happen under the following conditions:
[list]
[*]there are no existing stacks
[*]the existing stacks are full[/list]

Example:  If you get a pod drop with new loot and two pawns pickup some before any is placed, they might pick different spots in the stockpile to haul to.  I'm working on a system where they can share with eachother which tile they plan on placing new loot on which should fix that issue.

[h1]Conflicts[/h1]
It looks like there might be a conflict with a wall light mod if your stash runs against the wall light.  If you have wall lights against your stash take that tile out of your stockpile zone to prevent pawns from going into a loop of trying to haul over and over.  This issue isn't fixable by changing mod order unfortunately, I'll have to work with the mod creater on a solution.
This overwrites the builtin JobDriver_HaulToCell.  If any other mods overwrite the JobDriver for hauling this mod will throw tile reservation errors.  This mod should be compatible with most other mods but let me know if you have any problems.
