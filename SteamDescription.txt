[h1]Compatible with Versions 1.0-1.4[/h1]
  
[h1]Features[/h1]
Haulers will prioritize hauling to an existing stack even when multiple pawns are hauling.
Haulers no longer reserve the haul-to tile meaning multiple pawns can haul to the same tile at once.


[h1]Issues[/h1]
If your pawns are just standing around go here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/949498803/1500126447404876222/] Standing Bug [/url]
If your having other problems leave a comment with a description of your issue and/or feel free to message me in the steam group chat I've created [url=https://s.team/chat/PtlArmZM]here[/url].  It's a better way to discuss issues you might be having.
You may still see your pawns haul to different stacks, this will happen under the following conditions:
[list]
[*]there are no existing stacks
[*]the existing stacks are full
[*]pawn is hauling more than the destination stack can hold[/list]
Example:  If you get a pod drop with new loot and two pawns pickup some before any is placed, they might pick different spots in the stockpile to haul to.  I'm working on a system where they can share with eachother which tile they plan on placing new loot on which should fix that issue.

[h1]Conflicts[/h1]
This mod doesn't work well with PickUpAndHaul.  Using both won't cause the game to crash or anything.. my mod just doesn't really work when you're using PickUpAndHaul.  I looked into potentially fixing this but due to how PickUpAndHaul is written, a fix for this particular issue is beyond my current skill level.  I do revisit this conflict occasionally but unfortunately I don't anticipate ever actually pushing out a fix.  That being said I've created a discussion thread you can subscribe to if you'd like updates on the status of this conflict if I have any (I locked the thread so you won't get 'I have this issue too' notifications)
